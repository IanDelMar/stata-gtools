using weights in pctile seems to give incorrect results under some
circumstances. Only 1 / 9 pctiles were off by an average of
.0000253. This is likely due to this quirk in pctile rather than an
error in your code (pay special attention to the weighted gcollapse
comparison to check)

gquantiles_switch_sanity (many duplicates)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Testing whether gquantiles method switch code is sane for quantiles.
The table shows the actual ratio between method 1 and method 2 vs the
ratio used to decide between the two. Method 2 is chosen if the ratio
in parenthesis is > 1, and method 1 is chosen otherwise.

    - Good choice: Both are larger than 1 or less than 1.
    - OK choice: Actual ratio is close to 1 and decision ratio was off.
    - Poor choice: Actual ratio is far from 1 and decision ratio was off.

I think 'far from one' is a deviation of 0.2 or more.

gquantiles_switch_sanity (no duplicates)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Testing whether gquantiles method switch code is sane for quantiles.
The table shows the actual ratio between method 1 and method 2 vs the
ratio used to decide between the two. Method 2 is chosen if the ratio
in parenthesis is > 1, and method 1 is chosen otherwise.

    - Good choice: Both are larger than 1 or less than 1.
    - OK choice: Actual ratio is close to 1 and decision ratio was off.
    - Poor choice: Actual ratio is far from 1 and decision ratio was off.

I think 'far from one' is a deviation of 0.2 or more.

Testing whether gquantiles method switch code is sane for cutoffs.
The table shows the actual ratio between method 1 and method 2 vs the
ratio used to decide between the two. Method 2 is chosen if the ratio
in parenthesis is > 1, and method 1 is chosen otherwise. Note that
there is no quantile selection here, so the rule must be different.

    - Good choice: Both are larger than 1 or less than 1.
    - OK choice: Actual ratio is close to 1 and decision ratio was off.
    - Poor choice: Actual ratio is far from 1 and decision ratio was off.
