Compiling
=========

Compiling the plugin yourself is advised if you are on Linux or OSX and you
wish to speed up gtools. I ran the Stata/MP benchmarks on a server that used
the plugin I compiled locally. This was because most people will have that
experience (i.e. they will not compile the plugin themselves).

However, if I compile the plugin on the server then gtools can be up to
2 times faster (YMMV). This is because the optimization flags of the
compiler perform different optimizations in different hardware.

### Requirements

If you want to compile the plugin yourself, you will, at a minimum, need

- The GNU Compiler Collection (`gcc`)
- `git`

The plugin additionally requires:

- v2.0 of the [Stata Plugin Interface](https://stata.com/plugins/version2) (Stata 13 and earlier).
- v3.0 of the [Stata Plugin Interface](https://stata.com/plugins) (Stata 14 and later).
- [`premake5`](https://premake.github.io)
- [`centaurean`'s implementation of SpookyHash](https://github.com/centaurean/spookyhash)

However, I keep a copy of Stata's Plugin Interface in this repository, and I
have added `centaurean`'s implementation of SpookyHash as a submodule.  Hence
as long as you have `gcc`, `make`, and `git`, you fill be able to compile the
plugin following the instructions below.  

On OSX, you can get `gcc` and `make` from xcode. On windows, you will need

- [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com) with `gcc`, `make`, `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc-5.4.0.exe`
  (Cygwin is pretty massive by default; I would install only those packages).

If you also want to compile SpookyHash on Windows yourself, you will also need

- [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com) with the
  Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt (again, this is pretty massive
  so I would recommend you install the least you can to get the
  Developer Prompt).

I keep a copy of `spookyhash.dll` in `./lib/windows` so there is no need
to re-compile SpookyHash. In fact, I would advise **against** trying to
recompile SpookyHash on Windows unless you are using Windows Server (see
[this bug report](https://github.com/mcaceresb/stata-gtools/issues/35)).

### Compilation

Note that lines 37-40 in `lib/spookyhash/build/premake5.lua` cause the build
to fail on some systems, so we delete them (they are meant to check the git
executable exists).

```bash
bash

git clone https://github.com/mcaceresb/stata-gtools
cd stata-gtools
git submodule update --init --recursive
make clean
sed -i.bak -e '37,40d' lib/spookyhash/build/premake5.lua
```

If you are on Windows, or if `premake5` is installed and in your system's
`PATH`, run

```bash
make spooky
```

If you are Linux and OSX and you don't know how to install `premake5`, run

```bash
cd lib/spookyhash/build

url=https://github.com/premake/premake-core/releases/download
version=5.0.0.alpha4

# Linux
curl -OL ${url}/v${version}/premake-${version}-linux.tar.gz
tar zxvf premake-${version}-linux.tar.gz

# OSX
curl -OL ${url}/v${version}/premake-${version}-macosx.tar.gz
tar zxvf premake-${version}-macosx.tar.gz

# Make spookyhash
./premake5 gmake
make clean
ALL_CFLAGS+=-fPIC make

cd -
```

To finish, compile the plugin

```bash
make clean SPI=2.0 SPIVER=v2
make clean SPI=3.0 SPIVER=v3
SPOOKYPATH=$(dirname `find ./lib/spookyhash/ -name "*libspookyhash.a"`)

# Stata 13 and earlier
make all SPI=2.0 SPIVER=v2 SPOOKYPATH=${SPOOKYPATH}

# Stata 14 and later
make all SPI=3.0 SPIVER=v3 SPOOKYPATH=${SPOOKYPATH}
```

### Unit tests

From a stata session, run
```stata
do build/gtools_tests.do
```

(Note this can take several hours.)  If successful, all tests should report to
be passing and the exit message should be "tests finished running" followed by
the start and end time.

### Troubleshooting

I test the builds using Travis and Appveyor; if both builds are passing
and you can't get them to compile, it is likely because you have not
installed all the requisite dependencies. For Cygwin in particular, see
`./src/plugin/gtools.h` for all the include statements and check if you have
any missing libraries.

Loading the plugin is a bit trickier. Historically, the plugin has failed on
some windows systems and some legacy Linux systems. The Linux issue is largely
due to versioning. That is, while the functions I use should be available on
most systems, the package versions are too recent for some systems. If this
happens please submit a bug report.

On Windows the issue is largely due to Stata not being able to find the
SpookyHash library, `spookyhash.dll` (Stata does not look in the ado path by
default, just the current directory and the system path). I keep a copy in
`./lib/windows` but the user can also run

```
gtools, dependencies
```

If that does not do the trick, run

```
gtools, dll
```

before calling a gtools command (should only be required once per
script/interactive session). Alternatively, you can keep `spookyhash.dll` in
the working directory or run your commands with `hashlib()`. For example,

```
gcollapse (sum) varlist, by(varlist) hashlib(C:\path\to\spookyhash.dll)
```

Other than that, as best I can tell, all will be fine as long as you use the
MinGW version of gcc and SpookyHash was built using visual studio. That is,

- `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc` instead of `gcc` in cygwin for the plugin,
- `premake5 vs2013`, and
- `msbuild SpookyHash.sln` for SpookyHash

Again, you can find the dll pre-built in `./lib/windows/spookyhash.dll`; but if
you neet to re-compile SpookyHash, you have to force `premake5` to generate
project files for a 64-bit version only (otherwise `gcc` will complain about
compatibility issues). Further, the target folder has not always been
consistent in testing. While this may be due to an error on my part, I have
found the compiled `spookyhash.dll` in

- `./lib/spookyhash/build/bin`
- `./lib/spookyhash/build/bin/x86_64/Release`
- `./lib/spookyhash/build/bin/Release`

Again, I advise against trying to re-compile SpookyHash on Windows. Just use
the dll provided in this repo.
