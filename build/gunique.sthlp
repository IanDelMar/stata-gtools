This is a fast option to the user written {opt unique}.
It is 4 to 26 times faster in Stata/IC and 4-12 times faster in MP

{title:Description}

{pstd}
{opt gunique} is a faster alternative to {help unique}. It reports the number
of unique values for the {it:varlist}. At the moment, its main difference from
{opt distinct} is that it always considers the variables jointly. It also has
slighly different options. For example, this supports the {opth by(varlist)}
option that also appears in the {opt unique} command, but does not support
computing the number of unique values for variables individually.

{pstd}
{opt gunique} is part of the {manhelp gtools R:gtools} project.

{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}

{phang}
{opth by(varlist)} counts unique values within levels of {it:varlist} and
stores them in a new variable named {bf:_Unique}. The user can specify the
name of the new variable via the option {opth gen:erate(varname)}.

{phang}
{opth gen:erate(varname)} supplies an alternative name for the new variable
created by {bf:by}.

{phang}
{opt replace} replaces {bf:_Unique} or the variable specified via {opt
generate}, if it exists.

{phang}
{opt detail} request summary statistics on the number of records which are
present for unique values of the varlist.

{phang}
{opt verbose} prints some useful debugging info to the console.

{phang}
{opt benchmark} prints how long in seconds various parts of the program
take to execute. The user can also pass {opth bench(int)} for finer control.
{opt bench(1)} is the same as benchmark but {opt bench(2)} 2 additionally
prints benchmarks for internal plugin steps.

{phang}
{opth hashlib(str)} On earlier versions of gtools Windows users had a problem
because Stata was unable to find {it:spookyhash.dll}, which is bundled with
gtools and required for the plugin to run correctly. The best thing a Windows
user can do is run {opt gtools, dependencies} at the start of their Stata
session, but if Stata cannot find the plugin the user can specify a path
manually here.
